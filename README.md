# Full-Stack Engineering Exercise

## Purpose

This exercise is designed to reflect **real-world engineering work** at Registry Direct.

We are not testing your ability to write code without assistance. In day-to-day work, we use tools such as documentation, search, and AI coding assistants — and you are welcome to do the same here.

What we care about most is:
- how you **approach problems**
- how you **make decisions and trade-offs**
- how well you **understand and can explain** the system you build

There is no single “correct” solution.

---

## What You’re Building

Build a small full-stack application that meets the following **high-level goals**.

### Core Goals

**Backend**
- Expose an API that allows creating and retrieving records of your choosing.
- Persist data using a mechanism you believe is appropriate.

**Frontend**
- A simple UI that interacts with your API.
- Users should be able to view and create data through the interface.

**General Expectations**
- Clear project structure
- Sensible separation of concerns
- Reasonable error handling
- Code another engineer could understand and extend

You may use **any language, framework, or library** you feel is appropriate.

A minimal implementation that satisfies the core goals is perfectly acceptable.

---

## Intentional Ambiguity

Some requirements are intentionally vague.

This is deliberate.

We want to see:
- what assumptions you make
- what trade-offs you choose
- what you decide *not* to build

There is no expectation that everything is complete or production-ready.

---

## AI Usage

You **may use AI tools** (e.g. ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude).

If you do, please include:
- how you used them
- where they helped
- what you changed or decided yourself

We are evaluating **how thoughtfully you use tools**, not whether you used them.

---

## What to Submit

### 1. Code
- A GitHub repository containing your solution
- Clear instructions for running the project locally

### 2. README (Required)

Your README should include the following sections:

#### a) Overview
- What you built
- How the system fits together

#### b) Key Decisions & Trade-Offs
Explain *why* you chose:
- your tech stack
- data model
- API design
- frontend approach

Mention alternatives you considered and why you didn’t choose them.

#### c) What You’d Do Next
If you had more time:
- what would you improve?
- what would you refactor?
- how would you approach testing, scaling, or deployment?

#### d) AI Usage (If Any)
- Tools used
- How they influenced the solution
- Any limitations or issues encountered

---

## Time Expectation

We expect this exercise to take **around 2 hours**.

Please treat this as a **hard time limit** — do **not** feel pressure to complete everything.

We value:
- clear thinking
- sensible decisions
- good explanations

more than feature completeness.

If you run out of time:
- stop coding
- document what you would do next
- explain any trade-offs you made

This will **not** negatively affect your evaluation.

---

## How We Evaluate

We do **not** optimise for:
- number of features
- UI polish
- clever tricks

We *do* look for:
- clarity of thought
- reasonable engineering decisions
- readable, maintainable code
- ability to explain and defend your approach

---

## Next Step

If you proceed to the next stage, we will:
- discuss your submission in detail
- ask you to explain specific parts of your solution
- include a short live coding or debugging exercise based on your work

---

## Final Notes

This exercise is intended to be:
- practical
- fair
- reflective of real engineering work in 2025

We care much more about **how you think** than about perfect code.

Good luck — and enjoy the process.

## Candidate FAQ

### Do I need to finish everything?
No.

We do **not** expect a complete or production-ready solution.

A minimal implementation that clearly demonstrates your thinking is perfectly acceptable. We value clarity and reasoning more than completeness.

If you run out of time, stop coding and document what you would do next.

---

### Can I use AI tools?
Yes.

You may use AI tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot, or Claude.

If you do, please include a short description of:
- how you used them
- where they helped
- what decisions you made yourself

We care about how thoughtfully you use tools, not whether you use them.

---

### What if I don’t know which technologies to choose?
That’s okay.

There is no required tech stack. Choose tools you’re comfortable with and explain **why** you chose them.

We are more interested in your reasoning than in the specific technologies.

---

### Should I add authentication, testing, or deployment?
Only if you believe it meaningfully supports your solution.

These are **not required**. If you choose not to implement them, briefly explain what you would do in a real production environment.

---

### How much time should I spend?
We expect this exercise to take **around 2 hours**.

Please treat this as a hard time limit. You will not be penalised for stopping early or leaving things unfinished.

---

### Is UI design important?
No.

We are not evaluating visual design. A simple, functional UI is sufficient.

---

### How will my submission be evaluated?
We focus on:
- clarity of thinking
- sensible engineering decisions
- code readability and structure
- your ability to explain and reason about your choices

We do not score based on feature count or polish.

---

### What happens in the follow-up interview?
If you proceed:
- we will discuss your submission in detail
- ask about your design and trade-offs
- include a short live coding or debugging task related to your solution

The live task is collaborative and not designed to trick you.

---

### What if I get stuck or run out of time?
That’s completely fine.

Explain what blocked you, what you tried, and what you would do next. This is often more informative than additional code.

---

### Can I reuse or adapt existing code?
Yes, as long as you understand it and can explain it.

If you reuse templates or examples, briefly mention this in your README.

---

### What if I don’t normally build full-stack apps?
That’s okay.

Focus on the areas you’re strongest in, and keep other parts minimal or stubbed. Explain your approach and trade-offs.

---

### Who can I contact if something is unclear?
If anything about the exercise is unclear, feel free to reach out. We’re happy to clarify expectations.
