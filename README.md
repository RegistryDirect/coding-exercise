# Full-Stack Engineering Exercise

## Purpose

This exercise is designed to reflect **real-world engineering work** at Registry Direct. We are not testing your ability to write code without assistance. In day-to-day work, we use tools such as documentation, search, and AI coding assistants — and you are welcome to do the same here.

What we care about most is:
- how you **approach problems**
- how you **make decisions and trade-offs**
- how well you **understand and can explain** the system you build

There is no single “correct” solution.

---

## What You’re Building

You will build a **minimal share registry**.

The system should allow:

1. **Creating and viewing shareholders**
2. **Creating buy and sell transactions for shareholders**

That’s it — no other features are required for the take-home portion.  
You may choose **any language, framework, persistence approach, or architecture** — part of this exercise is choosing how you want to go about it.

Treat this as a simple system where:
- a **shareholder** represents a person or entity holding shares
- a **buy transaction** adds shares for a shareholder
- a **sell transaction** removes shares from a shareholder

You do **not** need any prior knowledge of finance or share registry domains — this is just flavour context.

We intentionally keep this scope minimal so that in the next stage (the live interview), we can ask you to extend or validate the system further.

## Core Goals

### Backend

- Expose an API that allows creating and retrieving records for:
  - shareholders
  - buy and sell transactions
- Persist data using a mechanism you believe is appropriate (in-memory storage is fine)

### Frontend

- A simple UI that interacts with your API
- Users should be able to view and create:
  - shareholders
  - transactions

### General Expectations

- Clear project structure
- Sensible separation of concerns
- Reasonable error handling
- Code another engineer could understand and extend

A **minimal implementation** that satisfies the core goals is perfectly acceptable.

You may use **any language, framework, or library** you feel is appropriate.

---

## Intentional Ambiguity

Some requirements are intentionally vague. This is deliberate. We want to see:
- what assumptions you make
- what trade-offs you choose
- what you decide *not* to build

There is no expectation that everything is complete or production-ready.

---

## AI Usage

You **may use AI tools** (e.g. ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude).

If you do, please include:
- how you used them
- where they helped
- what you changed or decided yourself

We are evaluating **how thoughtfully you use tools**, not whether you used them.

---

## What to Submit

### 1. Code

- A GitHub repository containing your solution  
- Clear instructions for running the project locally

### 2. README (Required)

Your README should include the following sections:

#### a) Overview
- What you built
- How the system fits together

#### b) Key Decisions & Trade-Offs

Explain *why* you chose:
- your tech stack
- data model
- API design
- frontend approach

Mention alternatives you considered and why you didn’t choose them.

#### c) What You’d Do Next

If you had more time:
- what would you improve?
- what would you refactor?
- how would you approach testing, scaling, or deployment?

#### d) AI Usage (If Any)

- Tools used
- How they influenced the solution
- Any limitations or issues encountered

---

## Time Expectation

We expect this exercise to take **around 2 hours**. Please treat this as a **hard time limit** — do **not** feel pressure to complete everything.

We value:
- clear thinking
- sensible decisions
- good explanations

more than feature completeness.

If you run out of time:
- stop coding
- document what you would do next
- explain any trade-offs you made

This will **not** negatively affect your evaluation.

---

## How We Evaluate

We do **not** optimise for:
- number of features
- UI polish
- clever tricks

We *do* look for:
- clarity of thought
- sensible engineering decisions
- readable, maintainable code
- ability to explain and defend your approach

---

## Next Step

If you proceed to the next stage, we will:
- discuss your submission in detail
- ask you to explain specific parts of your solution
- include a short live coding or debugging exercise based on your work

---

## Final Notes

This exercise is intended to be:
- practical
- fair
- reflective of real engineering work in 2025

We care much more about **how you think** than about perfect code.

Good luck — and enjoy the process.
